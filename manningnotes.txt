 [mongo intro]
 one app one dbase
 one dbase can have one or more collections
 u can think a collection is one fancy array
 e.g blog application has collection of blog posts
 each collection will have any number of documents (objects with various properties)
 application -> dbase -> collections --> documents
 each document will have unique _id property

 mongo doc, sql record
 mongo collection, sql table
 mongo document can embed other document (e.g. blog post embed comments), sql need two tables
 mongo db can have many collections, sql can have many tables

 for node to talk with mongo, the mongoose library is needed
